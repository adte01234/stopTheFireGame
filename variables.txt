Write all variables here in text with a short explanation if nescessary
It's good for everyone's sanity :)

Fire mob location and status:
mobFireArray[i].mobXPos
mobFireArray[i].mobYPos
mobFireArray[i].mobStatus. (0 for dead and 1 for alive)
Note that these values are stored in an array. Have stored number of mobs in var mobNumber. Check mobSpawner.js to see more.

mobFireArray[] (array for storing the mob array)
fireMob (image of fire mob)
mobsKilled (will affect score tally)

2 Other arrays are:
extraFireMobArray
speedFireMobArray  
They should act exactly the same, but they spawn based off how many normal mobs you kill. 
extraFireMob has 5 lives. It only dies when you shoot it 5 times.
speedFireMob moves 5px per loop. It remains static for now.


John, use scoreForFunction

Forests
forestsLeft (same as life)
