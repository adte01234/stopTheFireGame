Game plan is just for planning. Use it as a to do list.

To do list:
- Make the game playable

Ben to do list:
- Insert main character sprite


Adrian list:
- Mob spawner -> store xPos, yPos and status
- Mob ai
- Game over when 3 burnt forests
- Score tally on amount of mobs killed


John list:
- water + bullet = nothing
- forest + burnt forest = burnt forest


Nick list:
- 3 Forests


Extra ideas:
- Walls with limited health? 
- Turrets with limited ammo/time?
- Mob types:
    9 different fire enemy mobs. 3 for each row they spawn on. The difference is the direction they are going.
    If one forest is lit, mobs 1, 4 and 7 are disabled. Mob type 2,3,5,6,8, and 9 are still spawning.If
